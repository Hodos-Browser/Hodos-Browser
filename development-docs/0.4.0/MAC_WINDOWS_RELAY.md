# Mac ⇄ Windows relay (0.4.0) — cross-device coordination hub

Both the Windows Claude session and the Mac Claude session coordinate through THIS doc (committed to
`origin/0.4.0`). Pull before reading; push after writing.

# ⭐ CURRENT REALITY (2026-08-04) — Windows is RUNNING on CEF 150. Mac is GREENLIT to build.

**Everything below this section dated 2026-07-09 or earlier is historical.** In particular the old
"this sprint is docs/research only — do NOT write engine code" directive is **superseded**: the
Windows side has built the engine and shipped the app onto it.

## Where Windows got to

| | |
|---|---|
| Engine | **CEF 150** — `150.0.17+g94c1726+chromium-150.0.7871.187`, self-built, `BUILD_EXIT=0` in 4h49m |
| Codecs | Layer-A verified, all GATE rows `probably`, AV1 present, HEVC unchanged |
| App | **RUNS.** `CefInitialize` success, 18 processes, backends on 31401/31402, header + `tab_1`, V8 + farbling active, 0 errors |
| Commit | `1f98dba` bootstrap migration → `cf3b085` S0 staging + CI asset → `b8b8a13` S1 icon/VERSIONINFO. **2a + 1 + 3 done; only 2b (sandbox ON) left**, plus S3 (logging). |

Farbling is still the **JS injection in the embedder** (`FingerprintScript.h`), unchanged. Moving it
into Blink is P4 and has not started — no `hodos_*` patches exist in `cef/patch/patches/` yet.

### ⚠️ Two things from the 2026-08-04 S0/S1 session that WILL affect you

1. **Your CI asset is `cef-binaries-macos.tar.bz2` and it is still M136.** The `cef-binaries` release
   lives on **`Hodos-Browser/Hodos-Browser`** (the signing org repo), *not* on `origin` — that
   surprised the Windows side. When your 150 build is green, upload as a **new** asset
   (`cef-binaries-macos-150.tar.bz2`) rather than clobbering, and point `release.yml:440` at it on
   the `0.4.0` branch only. Reason: `main`/`staging` are still pre-bootstrap, and pointing the shared
   filename at 150 breaks their build. Windows did exactly this at `release.yml:118`.
   **Both platforms collapse back to the unversioned names when 0.4.0 lands on main.**
2. **⛔ Do not merge-copy the 150 distribution over your existing `cef-binaries/`.** CMake probes
   `${CEF_ROOT}/libcef_dll/wrapper/build/Release` **before** the dist's own wrapper location, and a
   stale wrapper left at the first path wins the probe, links cleanly, and then corrupts memory at
   runtime. Move the old tree away wholesale, then copy. Also note `CEF_ROOT` is a **cache**
   variable — dropping `-DCEF_ROOT` keeps the old value; use `cmake -U CEF_ROOT`.

Windows-only (no mac action, recorded so the platforms don't diverge silently): `HodosBrowser.exe`
is now branded post-build by `cef-native/tools/stamp_win_resources.cpp`, and `hodos.rc`'s icon id was
a **named** resource (`IDI_ICON1`) rather than integer `1`, so the window icon had never been set on
Windows — `LoadImage` failed with 1813 and the `if (hIcon)` guard swallowed it. macOS uses `.icns`
in the bundle and is unaffected.

### ⚠️ 2026-08-04 late — deconfliction, and one bug macOS SHARES

**🔴 macOS has the same mute-engine bug. `cef_browser_shell_mac.mm:5273` sets
`settings.log_file` to the relative `"debug.log"`.** Chromium rejects a relative log destination
outright (`Invalid logging destination`) on every launch, so the engine cannot report **anything** —
on Windows this blinded an entire sandbox investigation until it was fixed. Worth fixing on the Mac
before the 150 bring-up, because that is exactly when you need the engine to be able to talk.

> ⚠️ **You cannot reuse the Windows fix verbatim.** It routes through `AppPaths::GetLogDir()`, which
> is Windows-only (`EnvUtf8_(L"APPDATA")` + backslashes; `AppPaths.h` has no `__APPLE__` arm). Build
> the mac path the way that file already builds its Application Support paths at `:5263` / `:5305`
> (`GetAppDirName()` + `NSString`), i.e. `~/Library/Application Support/<appdir>/logs/cef_debug.log`.

**✅ UPDATE 2026-08-04 (late): Windows has SOLVED the sandbox.** 14 renderers at UNTRUSTED, real
sites rendering, 0 errors. Full write-up in `chromium-rebuild/NEXT_STEPS_AFTER_COMMIT1.md` §S2.
Still **do not turn the sandbox on for macOS as part of the 150 bump** — it is its own change, on its
own platform, and should follow your bring-up rather than ride along with it. But read the root
cause now, because the shape of it is cross-platform:

> **A sandboxed child process does not inherit `HODOS_DEV`.** On Windows the dev safeguard ran
> *before* `CefExecuteProcess`, so it fired in every child, failed there, and `return 1`'d — every
> renderer exited with `RESULT_CODE_KILLED` before any crash handler existed. No dump, no log, and
> the renderer never lived long enough to appear in the process list. It cost two sessions.

What this means for macOS specifically:

- **You dodge the exact bug.** Your helper processes enter through `mac/process_helper_mac.mm`, which
  has no dev safeguard; `cef_browser_shell_mac.mm :: main` runs only in the browser process.
- **⚠️ But you have the same hazard one layer down.** `process_helper_mac.mm` calls
  `AppPaths::GetAppDirName()` **in the render process** to pick the history DB. That reads
  `HODOS_DEV`. If macOS sandboxed helpers also lose the environment, a dev build's renderer would
  resolve to the **production** Application Support directory and open the production history DB —
  a dev/prod isolation break, not just a crash. Worth checking whenever you do enable the sandbox.
- **Related divergence worth a look regardless of the sandbox:** that file's comment says it matches
  "the Windows render-process fix", but Windows commit **2a moved `HistoryManager` OFF the renderer
  entirely**. macOS still initialises it there, so the two platforms are no longer doing the same
  thing and the comment is stale.
- **Rule to carry:** never gate child-process behaviour on an environment variable. Pass a
  command-line switch, the way `SimpleApp::OnBeforeChildProcessLaunch` already passes `--profile=`.
  (Three env-gated diagnostics silently no-op'd in children during this investigation and produced
  three false "exonerations".)

Two Windows specifics that do **not** transfer:

- Part of the Windows fix was removing `settings.browser_subprocess_path`, which silently disables
  the sandbox there. On **macOS that setting is required** (`:5429`, the helper bundles) — do not
  copy that.
- `no_sandbox = true` at `:5278` is unconditional on macOS. Leave it for now.

**Branching.** Both sides have been committing to `0.4.0` and **neither has pushed**, which is the
real collision risk — not the code. Windows is now paused (S2 blocked) with 6 unpushed commits;
macOS is active. Recommend macOS take **`0.4.0-mac`** and Windows keep `0.4.0`, then one deliberate
merge. The file most likely to conflict is **`cef-native/CLAUDE.md`** — Windows rewrote the engine
pin table and the bootstrap section, and macOS will want to edit the *same table* the moment it
lands 150. `release.yml` is lower risk (the two arms are ~320 lines apart and auto-merge cleanly).

**No action needed:** `AboutSettings.tsx` no longer hardcodes the engine version — it derives from
`navigator.userAgent`, so a macOS build on M136 correctly shows "Chromium (CEF 136)" and will follow
you to 150 by itself.

## → FOR THE MAC CLAUDE SESSION: start your CEF 150 build NOW

The ~5-hour cold Chromium build is the long pole and is **completely independent** of anything
Windows is still doing. Start it before you read anything else. Pin the same target:
`150.0.17+g94c1726+chromium-150.0.7871.187`. Follow `DevOps-CICD/CEF_BUILD_RUNBOOK.md`, whose
"Lessons learned" section now carries eight build failure modes Windows hit — read them *before*
you start, several cost hours.

### ⚠️ Four adaptations Windows needed AFTER the build went green

The engine building is **not** the same as the app running on it. Windows needed four further
changes to link and launch. Two of them apply to you; know them now rather than rediscovering them.

| # | Adaptation | Applies to macOS? |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **C++20 is mandatory** | ✅ **YES.** `include/base/cef_scoped_refptr.h` uses `requires(std::convertible_to<U*,T*>)`, so CEF 150 headers **do not parse under C++17**. CEF's own `cmake/cef_variables.cmake` moved `/std:c++17` → `-std=c++20`, so the wrapper is a C++20 build and you must match it. Our `CMakeLists.txt` currently sets `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20` **inside `if(WIN32)`** — flip the mac arm when you take the bump. First symptom is a wall of `convertible_to` errors *inside CEF headers*, which reads like a corrupt checkout. It isn't. |
| 2 | **`NOMINMAX`** | ❌ Windows-only (`windows.h` `min`/`max` macros vs 150's new `std::min` / `numeric_limits::max()` uses). |
| 3 | **`--disable-features=GlicActorUi`** | ✅ **YES — this one will crash you.** Chromium 150 ships its AI "Actor" UI `FEATURE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT`. `ActorUiContentsContainerController::OnWebContentsAttached` → `tabs::TabInterface::GetFromContents()` **null-derefs for any CEF-hosted `WebContents`**, because CEF's contents are not real Chrome tabs. Already fixed cross-platform in `simple_app.cpp :: OnBeforeCommandLineProcessing`, so you inherit the fix — **do not remove it.** See the two traps below. |
| 4 | **Reopen `stdout`/`stderr` on `NUL` when the log redirect fails** | ❌ Windows-only as written (it is inside the Windows `RunHodosMain`). But the *class* of bug is worth checking on mac: a failed `freopen` closes the stream, and `Logger::Log` echoes every line to `std::cout` unconditionally. |

**Two traps around #3, both of which cost Windows time:**

- It only bites **Chrome-style** browsers — and `runtime_style = CEF_RUNTIME_STYLE_DEFAULT`
  **means Chrome style** (`libcef/browser/browser_host_create.cc :: IsChromeStyle`). We never set
  `runtime_style`, so every `SetAsChild` tab/header is exposed. **Windowless/OSR overlays are immune**
  (windowless is always Alloy style). So the symptom is "tabs kill the process, overlays are fine."
- `CefCommandLine::AppendSwitchWithValue` **REPLACES** the value. `simple_app.cpp` already appends
  `--disable-features=Autofill,AutofillServerCommunication,GlicActorUi`, so a `--disable-features`
  passed on the command line is **silently discarded**. Anything new must join *that* list.
  Windows first "disproved" the fix this way.

### Crash-triage recipe (reuse it — it turned two opaque crashes into minutes)

1. **Get the untruncated exit code.** Bash reports Windows status mod 256, turning `0xC0000409` into
   a meaningless `9`. On mac the analogue is the signal number vs the crash report — go straight to
   the macOS crash reporter / `lldb`.
2. **Symbolize against the real symbols.** The `..._release_symbols` distribution carries
   `libcef.dll.pdb` / dSYMs. That is what named `ActorUiContentsContainerController` in one shot.
   Our Release build has no debug info by default — add it temporarily.
3. **Rule out the engine before blaming it.** The `..._client` distribution ships a prebuilt
   `cefclient`. If it runs, the engine is healthy and the fault is in our embedder.

### What does NOT apply to you

**The bootstrap model is Windows-only.** CEF 150's `bootstrap.exe` / client-DLL split (upstream
#3928) exists because Windows lost `cef_sandbox.lib`. macOS keeps its framework + helper-app
structure — your `CMakeLists.txt` link arm is untouched, and `Create*OverlayMacOS` etc. are
unaffected. Ignore `RunWinMain`, code-signing thumbprint matching, and the icon/VERSIONINFO work.

### Known-stale things you will trip over

- `cef-native/CLAUDE.md` documents **both** pins side by side now; mac is still M136 until you bump.
- `AboutSettings.tsx:39` hardcodes `"Chromium (CEF 136)"`. It moves when the engine actually ships.
- On macOS `settings.no_sandbox = true` is set **unconditionally** in `cef_browser_shell_mac.mm`,
  comment claims "for development" but it is not gated on dev/prod. Windows is also unsandboxed.
  Turning the sandbox on is a separate, deliberate change on both platforms — not part of the bump.

## CURRENT REALITY (2026-07-09) — auto-update saga CLOSED; channel repointed to the Chromium/CEF rebuild
- **Latest shipped = `v0.3.0-beta.26` (LATEST / live).** Nothing is in flight; the previous handoff
  round (beta.23 + mac dropdown-button consistency) is CONSUMED and archived below.
- **Windows SILENT auto-update is DONE + PROVEN LIVE** through the two-process profile picker
  (beta.25→26 applied silently on real hardware). macOS silent proven earlier (beta.21→22). The whole
  silent-update saga is complete: signer-continuity CN gate (beta.23), external rollback-supervisor,
  picker-gate exact-picker-exit-wait fix (commit `ae5beb6`, beta.26), `promote.yml` redirect-verify
  retry hardening, and `BUILD_AND_RELEASE` tag-derived version + draft→manual-promote gate.
- **Profile picker + per-profile-wallet architecture = SHELVED** (wallet stays SHARED). The
  same-process picker refactor is deferred. No picker work this sprint.
- Win10 overlay cluster (F1/F2/F3/F5), global settings across profiles, and bookmark favicon/delete
  all landed in beta.23. Mac dropdown-button consistency landed + smoked (see archive below).

## STANDING CHANNEL: Chromium/CEF rebuild sprint coordination
**This doc is now the standing Win⇄Mac coordination hub for the Chromium/CEF rebuild sprint.**
The sprint is RESEARCH + DESIGN first (NO code yet) — see the kickoff brief:
`development-docs/0.4.0/CHROMIUM_CEF_SPRINT_KICKOFF.md`.
- **Windows Claude = LEAD.** Mac Claude coordinates through this doc.
- Scope headlines: newest stable CEF, farbling→Blink-patch (owner committed), proprietary codecs,
  dependency/version bump. Open owner questions the design must answer: mac farbling, farbling×adblock,
  farbling×OAuth-preapproved, Amazon Widevine (on-demand CDM — OUT of beta.1 unless cheap).
- Deliverable target: `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_0_4_0_BETA1.md` (outline → auto-chained detailed impl
  plans with adversarial review).

### → FOR THE MAC CLAUDE SESSION
1. `git pull origin 0.4.0` before reading; `git push origin 0.4.0` after writing.
2. Read `CHROMIUM_CEF_SPRINT_KICKOFF.md`. This sprint is docs/research only — do NOT write engine code
   until the roadmap lands and the owner greenlights.
3. Own the **macOS-specific research/design inputs**: mac farbling approach (Blink-patch parity vs the
   current JS-injection farbling), mac codec/build implications, and any mac blockers for the CEF bump.
4. Report findings + open questions in "MAC → WINDOWS REPORT-BACK" below, then push.

### → FOR THE WINDOWS / RELEASE SIDE (heads-up)
- Windows is LEAD on the rebuild design and owns `IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP_0_4_0_BETA1.md`.
- Pull before consuming Mac's report-back; fold mac inputs into the roadmap.

## MAC → WINDOWS REPORT-BACK (Mac Claude fills this in + pushes)

_(Awaiting the next round — Chromium/CEF rebuild research inputs. Previous rounds archived below.)_

## ARCHIVE — consumed handoff rounds

### 2026-07-08 — beta.23 + mac dropdown-button consistency (SHIPPED, CONSUMED)
beta.23 shipped and is live; the mac dropdown-button consistency work landed + smoked and rode in it.
Profile picker was shelved that round and remains shelved.

**Mac commits:** (1) prior session M1–M3 build verify + Sparkle force-check-on-launch + picker full
flow + async server startup fix + port deconfliction (`MACOS_EXECUTION_RESULTS_2026_07_07.md`);
(2) dropdown button consistency — menu, profile, download brought to the 4-way reference pattern.

**Files:** `cef-native/cef_browser_shell_mac.mm` (menu overlay keep-alive helpers + dedicated
click-outside monitor with 0.3s debounce; `CreateMenuOverlayMac` + Show/Hide stubs → keep-alive
orderOut instead of destroy); `cef-native/src/handlers/simple_handler.cpp` (macOS IPC branches for
`profile_panel_show`/`menu_show`/`download_panel_show` → the 4-way
`if (!window) Create; else if (IsVisible) Hide; else if (WasJustHidden) suppress; else Show` pattern).

**Result:** clean macOS Release build (zero warnings/errors); all three dropdowns smoked (open, toggle-
close, click-outside close, keep-alive reuse); bookmark/site-info/tab-list reference branches untouched.
No blockers.

**Notes carried forward:** dev builds need ad-hoc signing after rebuild
(`codesign --force --deep --sign -`) to launch via `open`; direct terminal exec still works unsigned.
`AutoUpdater_mac.mm` force-check-on-launch stays enabled for all non-Off modes — Windows intentionally
narrowed this to Notify-only (WinSparkle shows prompts even in silent mode; Sparkle 2 handles silent
mode correctly), so the platforms differ here by design.
